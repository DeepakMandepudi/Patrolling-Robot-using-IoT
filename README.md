# Night Patrolling Robot with Sound Detection using IoT

An autonomous security robot designed to patrol and monitor premises using sound detection and real-time image capture, powered by Raspberry Pi and IoT technologies.

## Overview

This project features a night patrolling robot that performs security patrolling services by detecting sound waves in its surroundings and capturing images using a Pi camera. The robot is equipped with a sound sensor that triggers image capture upon sound detection, sending the captured images to a designated email address for further actions.
